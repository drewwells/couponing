Website built to handle manual operations.

Tired of doing so much manual work, I built a website to handle all the automated steps.  This surfaced the best data to me for ease of dragging and dropping onto our website.

Technologies involved:

- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
- [MongooseJS](http://mongoosejs.com/)
- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
- [HTML5 DnD](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/)

The infrastructure is built on the [MEAN stack](https://github.com/linnovate/mean).
